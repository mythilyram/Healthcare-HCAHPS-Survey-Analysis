# Healthcare-HCAHPS-Survey-Analysis
HCAHPS Patient Survey Analysis - American Hospital Association

### Challenge Objective
For the Maven Healthcare Challenge, you'll be working** as a Data Analyst for the American Hospital Association (AHA)**, a national organization that represents hospitals and their patients. It acts as a source of information on healthcare issues and trends.

- As part of your role, you've been asked **to analyze the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results for the last 9 years**.
- The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patients’ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its 3 main goals is to "create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care".

### Task
To evaluate whether the HCAHPS survey has been successful in accomplishing this goal by answering questions like these:

- Have hospitals' HCAHPS scores improved over the past 9 years?
- Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?
- Are there any major areas of opportunity remaining?
- What recommendations can you make to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?

### About The Data Set
National & state-level results from 2013 to 2022 for the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, including hospital-level completions and response rates.

### Net Promoter Score (NPS) 
To analyze the healthcare survey dataset, I`m going to use a Key Metric called NPS.
- It is a widely used metric to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- It is derived from responses to a simple survey question, On a scale of 0 to 10.
- Based on their responses, respondents are categorized into three groups:

  - Promoters (score 9-10): These are enthusiastic customers who are likely to recommend your product or service.

  - Passives (score 7-8): These customers are satisfied but not enthusiastic. They are unlikely to actively promote your product but are also unlikely to speak negatively about it.

  - Detractors (score 0-6): These customers are unhappy and may actively discourage others from using your product or service.

The NPS is then calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. 
- The formula is as follows:

> NPS=%Promoters−%Detractors
- NPS can range from -100 to +100, with positive scores indicating a higher likelihood of customer recommendation and negative scores suggesting room for improvement.
- NPS is a relative metric, and the score alone might not provide a comprehensive understanding of customer satisfaction. It is often more valuable when tracked over time or compared to industry benchmarks.
